# AirBNC

...about the project

## Getting Started

1: Ensure you've installed all dependencies using
```
npm install
```

2: Next, you will need to create an `airbnc_test` locally. A script has been created to achieve this. Run:

```
npm run setup-db
```

3: You'll need to store the credentials of the database inside a .env file at the root level of this project: 

```
PGDATABASE=airbnc_test
```
