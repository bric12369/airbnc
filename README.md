# AirBNC

...about the project

## Getting Started

1: To get started, you will need to create an `airbnc_test` locally. A script has been created to achieve this. Run:

```
npm run setup-db
```

2: The connection.js file creates a connection to the database stored in the .env file: 

```
PGDATABASE=airbnc_test
```
